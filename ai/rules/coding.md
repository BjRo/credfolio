# Coding Rules

- Prefer clear, descriptive names; avoid 1–2 character identifiers.
- Keep functions small with early returns; avoid deep nesting.
- Tests accompany non-trivial code paths.
- Use Biome for lint/format; fix all reported issues.
- Frontend TypeScript typechecks with `tsgo --noEmit`; `tsc` fallback available.
