When you're not clear about an API (frontend or backend), use context7 to verify that you're using the API correctly.

To do this, append `use context7` to your request so the related MCP is included and the actual library documentation can be consulted.

Possible scenarios where you might need this:

<scenarios>
- fixing linting errors related to a library API
- fixing tests that fail due to incorrect API usage
- generating new code for a library previously not used in the codebase
</scenarios>
