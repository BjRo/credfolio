When creating an requirement document, use the template you find in the [requirements directory](../../requirements/templates/).

Our goal is to be as specific as possible so that an agent can then implement the necessary features end to end.

<desired_outcome>
- A new requirements file has been created, incrementing the running number
- All placeholders in the template are filled out
- The new entry referencing that file has been added to the [Requirements index](../../requirements/index.md)
</desired_outcome>
