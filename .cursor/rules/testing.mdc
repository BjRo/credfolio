# Testing Policy

You **MUST** run the project's test suite to verify changes whenever you implement new features or refactor code.

## Execution

Run the full test suite using the Makefile:

```bash
make test
```

If you are working specifically on the backend or frontend, you may run the specific target to save time, but you should run the full suite before finishing a task.

- Backend only: `make test-backend`
- Frontend only: `make test-frontend`

## Failure Handling

- If `make test` fails, you **MUST** fix the errors before proceeding.
- Do not assume "it worked on my machine" or ignore test failures.
- If a test is flaky or broken unrelated to your changes, note it, but try to fix it if trivial.
