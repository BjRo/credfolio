When creating an Architecture Decision Record (ADR), use the template you find in the [adr directory](../../adr/templates/).

Our goal is to document all technical decisions that have a long-term, cross-cutting impact on the system in ADRs, so that we can later easily understand why they were made.

<scenarios>
- New libraries or tools are introduced
- Previous libraries or tools are phased out and removed
- New patterns are introduced
- Old patterns are phased out and removed
</scenarios>

<desired_outcome>
- A new ADR file has been created, incrementing the running number
- All placeholders in the template are filled out
- The new ADR has been added to the [ADR index](../../adr/index.md)
</desired_outcome>
